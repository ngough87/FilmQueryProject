# Lessons Learned

- The most significant lesson learned was how to connect to a database
to run queries and get results via eclipse. During this process, I was able to
confirm and troubleshoot query issues via the terminal.
- Something I found challenging was allowing the user to search via keyword.
Determining the correct sql syntax was especially challenging. I was able to figure
it out by doing a lot of online research and trial and error. Not something I will soon
forget.
- I wanted to keep the FilmQueryApp as simple as possible, in doing so, I created
an additional class FilmQueryEngine. Not sure if this was an appropriate placement
of methods, but I thought it made it a little easier to read.
